This directory is for the 442_mim_lf_schema test case schema.
It includes a copy of the AGREE application.
It includes one or more compiled jar files for the AGREE application to import.
It is based on SMRLv8, and includes versions for CR_part42 and CR_PMI_4 and for the guid application.


We are on the active branch: schema_rev1!

That branch has the descriptions of the entities: 442_mim_lf_schema/20210414_guid_descriptions.docx

If you don't see that file, change your branch to schema_rev1.

Note: The AGREE application does not support graphically editing the complex structure consisting of a SELECT followed by e.g., SET_REPRESENTATION_ITEM.
To support that, the target of the relevent attribute must be placed on the canvas first.
