This directory is for the 442_mim_lf_schema test case schema.
It includes a copy of the AGREE application.
It includes one or more compiled jar files for the AGREE application to import.
It is based on SMRLv8, and includes versions for CR_part42 and CR_PMI_4 and for the guid application.

Note: The AGREE application does not support graphically editing the complex structure consisting of a SELECT followed by e.g., SET_REPRESENTATION_ITEM.
To support that, the target of the relevent attribute must be placed on the canvas first.
