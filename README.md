# guid-data

## Purpose
This is a repository for data collected in the investigation of GUIDs for a standards-based digital thread of product data.  


## Standards in scope are:

- ISO 10303 Industrial automation systems and integration -- Product data presentation and exchange

- ANSI Quality Information Framework Standard v3.0, Dimensional Metrology Standards Consortium


## Five use cases are considered:
  
- Design to manufacturing release

- OEMs collaborate on a design iteration

-   Design change due to manufacturing feedback

-   Compare different versions or products

-   Design change due to test results


## The repository is organized as follows:

-   There is a origin/main branch with subdirectories for each test case design. 

-   There is a subdirectory for the 442 (ap242) mim longform schema for testing. 

-   That schema contains longform schema, plus an AGREE editor jar file plus an AP 242 mim long form. A description of the proposed entities for the long form schema is in file 442_mim_lf_schema/20210414_guid_descriptions.docx.

-   There is a registry directory for namespace and UUID name-value pairs.

## Most recent data

- repository branch -- 'origin/main' (critical as that affects all data validity)

- Test case directory -- guid-data/ISO_14405-1_2016_Figure_17a

- 442 long form schema file --guid-data/442_mim_lf_schema/mim_lf.exp
